                    <p class="section__text">This project is designed to help people be more aware about how socioeconomic status affects crimes that happen in New York State. The primary audience is aimed at helping security agencies to strategize how to mitigate and prevent crimes in areas with high crime rate, based on the area’s socioeconomic status. The secondary audience are residents of New York State who should be aware of the crime rate to take precautions in their own safety.</p>

                    <h3 class="section__heading">Designing the Visualizations</h3>

                    <p class="section__text">There are three interactions with two different visualizations. One is a scatter plot visualization that we used to see how a Countys' average income correlates with its population. The scatter plot visualization has the points in a shape to make it easier to distinguish each county’s point to each other  The second visualization is a bar graph that compares County’s type of crimes to each other.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section__text">Starting from the scatter plot visualization the user can hover on a point to view in detail the County’s name, average income and population count. Then the user can brush on the scatter plot visualization, it will link to a bar graph that would show for each County, the  sum of crime index count and the type of crimes. On the bar graph if you were to click on a County’s colour on a bar, it will filter to show only that County in each Crime count and filter on the scatter plot.</p>

                <article class="section__item">
                    <h3 class="section__heading">Reflections and Insights</h3>

                    <p class="section__text">Scatter Plot Visualization addresses the question “What is the income trend in a County’s population?”. The main insight is that New York County has a wide range of income and population. It says that their socio-economic status of the County is from the lower class to higher class and the population ranges from low to high as well. While Bronx shows to have a high amount of population but low income, we can see there is an outlier area in Bronx that has a large amount of population with low income.</p>

                    <p class="section__text">Bar Graph Visualization addresses the question “What are the common type of crime in each County?” Overall, the highest index count of the crimes would go to Kings and you can see when clicked on, that the type of crime that is common is Property Count. What is interesting is that Kings also has the highest Firearm crime count. The other County’s also has their common crime to be property.</p>

                    <p class="section__text">Together the Scatter Plot Visualization and Bar Graph Visualization addresses the question “Does County's economic status affect crime count?”. It may not address it exactly but there are insights from the scatter plot that shows economic status and the type of crime count. From the County, Kings, you can see that that their economic status is low to middle class with a cluster of middle population count. Compared to Bronx that has a pretty low population but has a huge range of income.  These new insights may not answer this question exactly but it does bring new questions up that would require more data. Does high income count mean low crime count? Vise versa, Does low income mean high crime count?</p>
